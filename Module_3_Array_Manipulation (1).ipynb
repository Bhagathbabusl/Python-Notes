        "\n",
        "Multi-dimensional arrays extend the concept of one-dimensional arrays to multiple dimensions. These arrays are particularly useful for representing matrices, tensors, and other higher-dimensional data structures commonly encountered in fields like machine learning and data science.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Indexing**: In multi-dimensional arrays, you need to specify an index for each dimension to access an individual element. For example, in a 2D array (matrix), you use two indices: one for the row and one for the column.\n",
        "- **Slicing**: Similar to one-dimensional arrays, slicing can be applied across multiple dimensions. This allows you to extract subarrays or submatrices, which is useful for various computational tasks.\n",
